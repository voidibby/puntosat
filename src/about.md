# **Visual artist, designer and researcher**

Adriana Torres Topaga born in Bogotá, Colombia. She’s a visual artist and designer based on Linz, Austria. Master degree as Industrial Designer from
Javeriana University of Bogotá, Master in Digitals Arts at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona and Master at space & design strategies at the
University of Art and Design Linz.

During the master study space&design strategies I was member of the “public space 2.0” research project group of the same Faculty, where had the possibility of taking part on the reﬂ ection of social practices-oriented design in public space and also on the development of a technological wearable garment.
(http://www.strategies-research.ufg.ac.at/public_space)

Some of my works show my fascination around the human body and the skin as a political space for questioning, ideals of gender, beauty, consum,
the privat and public, the relationship between new and low technologies around the human body. Other topics or my interest are art and collective
and interdisciplinary creation, design and methodology, materials research, consume culture, up-cycling, and social impact of design and arts.

I also collaborate actively at the migrant association [“maiz”- autonomous center from and for migrants in Linz](http://www.maiz.at/), Austria as graphic designer, member of the board of directors (2009-beginnt 2016) and recently escorting the project: ["Life carries weight":](http://maiz.at/en/node/1067) A project on health and nutrition in the context of migration and social tensions. As coordinator of the cultural area of this association in 2019.

Combininig some of my interests, I cofounde the platform LAB ON STAGE together with the performer Arnulfo Pardo, with the aim of exploring the relationship between body, space, movement, gestures, materials, techniques, as well the performance as a medium for interdisciplinary research and study of the creative process.

The focus of my artistic inquiry relies on both: the process than in what the outcome. My artistic practice develops independent from standards in
size and techniques, She reveals this diversity by doing interactive sculptures and spaces, performance, clothing, graphic design, Photography, video and sound and in the last 2 years increasingly performance.

Adriana Torres Topaga researches resistance practices and decolonial perspectives, works as an artist, graphic designer, active member for the association of migrants maiz in Linz, is co-founder of the association [LAB ON STAGE](http://puntos.at/LAB_SITE/lab_on_stage.html) and as a guest lecturer in different universities and Fh like the Kunst Universität Linz, Fh Bern, El Bosque University in Bogotá in the fields of critical social work and art.
In addition to the Gallery Forum (Wels) and the Kunstschaffende (Linz), she has also exhibited at the Afo Architecture Forum (Linz), CCCB (Barcelona), Ars Electronica Center (Linz), Time- Space-Existence (as part of the Venice Architecture Biennale) among others.

Interest in Body and perception, identity, body and spatial actions, migration, the public space, Cultural Hacking, politics of the image, wearables, art and design methodology, material research, consumerism, performativity, social impact of design and art, interdisciplinary and collective work.
