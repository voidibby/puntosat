I`m looking forward knowledge exchange, therefore I enjoy specially collective work.
In my artistic practice and research, I consider tthree different scopes which are interrelated: one answers to a personal intention towards socio-ecological reflection and transformation. The second persues interdisciplinary interaction and collective creation and the thrid shows my interest in the use of diferent kind of technologies and media.
This is reflected in some of my work that combines visual-sculptural expressions often with the perfomative in a individual or participative forms.
